#Date Check Code

I added the code in one commit - then realised I should have done it piecemeal to show the creation of tests and then the code to make the tests pass. 

Things to consider if given more time :-
1. Locale - will the call centre be in a different locale ? 
1. use an Immutable map for the storgae of the opening times ? 
1. refer the tests to the constants for times rather than hard coding.

`Instructions for Running` 
Download the repo - unzip it. 
---
To run the tests. 
mvn test 
in the root folder and all 10 tests will pass.
